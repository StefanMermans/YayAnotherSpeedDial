Dutch translation in the nl (Nederland or Netherlands in English) folder.

## Problems
### Word order theme applied count 
When showing how many times a theme is applied, the order of the words is different in Dutch than in English.

English:
- Applied 319 times

Dutch:
- 319 keer toegepast

This is relevant to the json fields "times" and "applied"
